# Overview of the Project
This C++ project is a simple command-line-based Student Management System that allows users to manage student records, including adding, editing, and deleting student information, as well as calculating and displaying grades. Below is an overview of the key components and functionality of the project.

1. Project Structure
Classes:
Student: Represents an individual student, storing their ID, name, and a list of grades. It includes methods for adding grades, calculating the average grade, and displaying student information.
StudentManagementSystem: Manages a collection of Student objects. It provides functionality for adding, editing, and deleting students, as well as for adding grades and displaying student information.

Main Functionality:
The main() function serves as the entry point of the program, where it displays a menu and handles user input to perform various operations like adding a student, editing student details, deleting a student, adding grades, and displaying student records.

2. Key Features
Adding a Student:
Users can add a new student by providing a name. Each student is automatically assigned a unique ID.
Editing Student Information:
Users can edit an existing student's name using their unique ID.
Deleting a Student:
Users can remove a student from the system by providing their unique ID.
Adding Grades:
Users can add grades to a student's record. The grades are stored in a list within the Student class.
Calculating and Displaying Grades:
The system can calculate the average grade for a student and display it along with the student's other information.
Displaying Information:
Users can view the details of a specific student or all students in the system.

3. Code Components
Student Class:
Contains private data members for storing the student's ID, name, and grades.
Provides methods like addGrade(), calculateAverageGrade(), and display() to manage and display student data.
StudentManagementSystem Class:
Manages a vector of Student objects.
Provides methods like addStudent(), editStudent(), deleteStudent(), addGrade(), displayStudent(), and displayAllStudents().
Includes a helper method findStudentById() to locate a student by their ID.
Main Program Loop:
The main() function contains a loop that continually presents the user with a menu of options.
Depending on the userâ€™s choice, the corresponding function from the StudentManagementSystem class is called to perform the requested operation.
The loop continues until the user chooses to exit the program.

4. User Interaction
Menu-Based Interface:
The program uses a simple text-based menu to interact with the user.
Users select options by entering a number corresponding to the desired action.
The program then prompts the user for any additional required information (e.g., student name, ID, grade).
Real-Time Feedback:
After performing an operation, the program provides immediate feedback, such as confirmation of successful actions or error messages if something goes wrong (e.g., entering an invalid student ID).

5. Extensibility
Scalability:
The system is designed to be simple and straightforward, but it can be extended with more advanced features like file handling (for persistent storage of student records), more complex grade calculations, or user authentication.
Customization:
The project can be customized or enhanced depending on specific requirements, such as adding additional data fields (e.g., age, address) or implementing a GUI instead of a command-line interface.

Conclusion
This project provides a fundamental example of how to manage and manipulate a collection of objects (students) in C++. It covers basic operations like adding, editing, and deleting records, as well as calculating and displaying data. This serves as a foundation for more complex student management systems or similar applications that require record-keeping and data manipulation.
